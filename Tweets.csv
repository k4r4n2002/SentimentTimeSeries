Watch my report from the @WhiteHouse for @greta on @newsmax at 6p ET."
2022-06-29 13:28:54+00:00,PeterSchiff,"The final read on Q1 GDP is now minus 1.6%. Since Q2 will likely be negative too, the #Fed and @JoeBiden will soon be forced to admit that Amercia's red hot economy has actually been in a #recession all year, which will only get far worse with high #inflation and more rate hikes."
2022-06-28 19:59:29+00:00,PeterSchiff,Today's outside reversal day likely means the bear-market rally is over and that #stocks will soon hit new lows. Investors are bracing for #recession and higher short-term interest rates than previously expected. But they're not bracing for #inflation remaining high despite both.
2022-06-28 16:14:38+00:00,PeterSchiff,Every time the economy enters #recession it takes a larger dose of monetary stimulus to get it out. That's because the stimulus prevents real solutions from taking place and sows the seeds of a worse recession to come. This recession will now require a fatal overdose of stimulus.

2022-06-27 16:10:31+00:00,PeterSchiff,Investors are making an even bigger mistake in thinking the #Fed will succeed in bringing #inflation back down to 2% than they did in thinking inflation was transitory. They are also mistaken in assuming that any potential #recession will be mild or that it will cure inflation.
2022-06-27 14:54:20+00:00,PeterSchiff,Busts are usually proportionate to the artificial booms that precede them. We had a financial crisis in 2008 and Great #Recession because the boom the #Fed created with 1% interest rates for about two years was so large. Imagine what follows 0% interest rates for nearly 14 years!
2022-06-27 12:59:16+00:00,PeterSchiff,"Anyone thinking this #recession will be mild doesn't understand recessions. The longer interest rates are held too low during a boom, the more mistake that must be corrected during a bust. Since rates have never been so low for so long, this recession will be the most severe yet."
2022-06-27 12:26:08+00:00,PeterSchiff,"Trying to avoid a #recession is a mistake. When artificially low interest rates result in economic mistakes, the best thing for the economy is to allow market forces to correct them. #Fed policy to avoid a recession that past policy mistakes made necessary is a bigger mistake."

In contrast, the #Fed is only worried about inflation, but is not concerned about recession. Soon investors and the Fed will be on the same page. They'll be petrified about both."

In reality, a severe recession will result in even higher inflation as the #Fed prints money like crazy to ""stimulate"" the economy, prop up asset prices and monetize Federal debt."
2022-06-23 15:15:59+00:00,PeterSchiff,"#Powell's confident prediction that the U.S. economy will experience strong real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 will prove just as wrong as his earlier forecast that #inflation was transitory. Not only will GDP growth not be strong, the U.S. will likely be in a #recession."
